Dear Ifung,

Best of luck in your future endeavours! It was fun working together, I learnt a hell of a lot from you. 
I'll also miss our put-the-world-to-rights banter. I am not sure we've finished that conversation yet - especially with the awesome fuck up of two days ago - so please stay in touch and let's continue the conversation!

All the very best,
