I am so happy that I've had the chance to work with you this last year. 
So many amazing conversations (about work... politics... family... the meaning of life...)
I will miss you a lot, but I can't wait to hear how things go at Native - sure you're gonna ace it over there. 

Hopefully we'll have a chance to work on something together some time in the future...
Maybe a revolution?!

See you soon! 
Madeleine

P.S. "Consider creative possibilities" is my new mantra.
