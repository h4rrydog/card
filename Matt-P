Dear Ifung, so sorry to learn that you are leaving HELIX we will all miss you. 
It has been great to get to know you over the last 2 years, I think you will be an incredible asset to whoever is lucky enough to hire you in the future, and I look forward to hearing about your future successes. 

Good luck, Matt
